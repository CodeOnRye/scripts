This is a repo of some random scripts I have created.

Currently there are the following:

===============
kbd_light_up.sh
===============
This is a script that toggles the backlight on the UX31A Zenbook up.  By default
install of Xubuntu 13.04 the keys do not work.  This is used to replace the
function combination.

=================
kbd_light_down.sh
=================
Similar to above, this lowers the backlight.
